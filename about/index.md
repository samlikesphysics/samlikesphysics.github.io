## ... the author
Samuel Loomis currently works at Syngenta Seeds as a complex systems modeler and holds a
PhD. in physics with his expertise in the physics of information. He applies
information-theory-based data science combined with physics-inspired models to
better understand the often messy, nonlinear and downright weird data collected
from complex systems of all shapes and sizes, including genomics, supply chains,
and agricultural systems. On the side he and his wife manage their own complex
system: Shangri-Haw Farm, a duck and goose farm oriented around regenerative grazing and
conservation breeding (for more details check out his [farm
blog](https://samsstack.wordpress.com) and [farm site](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61556405190798)).

## ... the blog
Sometimes when I'm deep in code-world I feel like Luke Skywalker, who learned to
wield a lightsaber only to lose his hand. Oftentimes when we are too cavalier
with the fancy data-processing tools we use, we lose something crucial as well---our ability to just
connect with the data and its source, to use data as a means of communication
instead of just control. 

I'm not against fancy (I even have a chicken named Fancy), but one thing I've always
loved about information theory and the way it taught me to look at data and
models is how simple it can be. It needs to be simple: every complex system is unique and embedded
deeply in its own context, so really only a simple, unassuming framework could
prove useful across the board, and I have never worked on a project where
information theory was not relevant at some point. Where it
is relevant, it is often for the same reason: because information-theoretic tools
help me to cut through the knot and just see what's going on in the data and
with my models.

So this blog is, by and large, about information
theory, the way of thinking it inspires and all the things you might do with it. 
I'll generally constrain myself to three kinds of posts:

1. Diving into information theory and all its characters, as well as related
   areas and tools, to educate others about this awesome field and its
   developments;
2. Deep-dive demos showing, with toy models and open datasets, how information
   theory can be applied to real problems;
3. Just-for-fun explorations of creative and unorthodox ways to get the data to
   talk to you.
