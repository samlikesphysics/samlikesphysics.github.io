## ... the author
Samuel Loomis currently works at Syngenta Seeds as a complex systems modeler and holds a
PhD. in physics with his expertise in the physics of information. He applies
information-theory-based data science combined with physics-inspired models to
better understand the often messy, nonlinear and downright weird data collected
from complex systems of all shapes and sizes, including genomics, supply chains,
and agricultural systems. On the side he and his wife manage their own complex
system: Shangri-Haw Farm, a duck and goose farm oriented around regenerative grazing and
conservation breeding (for more details check out his [farm
blog](https://samsstack.wordpress.com) and [farm site](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61556405190798)).

## ... the blog
Sometimes when I'm deep in model-world I feel like Luke Skywalker, who learned to
wield a lightsaber only to lose his hand. Oftentimes we approach data with a
mindset fixated on finding the "signal" and cutting away the "noise," and with
tools that help us do this. But when we make too-harsh modeling assumptions,
hacking away at the data without regard for its complexity,
we handicap our own ability to understand what's going on.

One thing I've always
loved about information theory and the way it taught me to look at data and
models is its simplicity. It needs to be simple: every complex system is unique
and domain-specific, so really only a simple, unassuming framework could
prove useful across the board. Information-theoretic tools
help us to quantify what can and cannot be
understood from the data in a model-agnostic way. It inverts our normal
perspective of only extracting the signal and tossing the noise, instead
modeling the noise and signal together as a whole. This allows information
theory to identify noisy, nonlinear, and multivariate relationships where
model-specific methods fail.

So this blog is, by and large, about information
theory, the way of thinking it inspires and all the things you might do with it. 
I'll generally constrain myself to three kinds of posts:

1. Diving into information theory and all its characters, as well as related
   areas and tools;
2. Deep-dive demos showing, with toy models and open datasets, how information
   theory can be applied to practical problems;
3. Just-for-fun explorations of creative and unorthodox ways to get the data to
   talk to you.
