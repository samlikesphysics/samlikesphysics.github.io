{% newthought 'Samuel P. Loomis' %} {% sidenote "One" "The P. is to distinguish myself from the Halloween
guy. You can just call me Sam." %}

I'm currently a 6th year PhD. student studying physics and complex systems at UC
Davis, in Jim Crutchfield's lab{% sidenote "Jim" "[Complexity Sciences
Center](http://csc.ucdavis.edu/Welcome.html)"%}.

me.'  %}

{% newthought '[My Curriculum
Vitae](/assets/docs/loomis-cv.pdf)' %} contains a detailed summary
of my past and ongoing experiences---but I'll list the quick facts here too.

My dissertation work has focused on
how complex systems process information, exploring applications in quantum
computing, machine learning, and most recently in carbon policy analysis. 
These are not as far apart as they might seem. A quantum computer producing
temporal data needs to take advantage of that data's structure to be maximally
efficient. That same structure is extremely relevant for inference, pattern discovery and
modeling. My Projects and 
[Publications](/publications/) pages give more detail on the research I do, and how it
all fits together.

{%newthought 'My home is in North Carolina,'%} though I live in Davis at the
moment. I grew up in Cary and received my undergraduate degrees in Physics and
Mathematics at North Carolina State University in Raleigh.

There I researched general
relativity under David Brown{% sidenote "JDB" "[GR at NC
State](https://relativity.wordpress.ncsu.edu/)" %}, who taught me a lot about
research, writing, and also manifold geometry. Though I no longer actively
study G.R., the tools and skills I learned then continue to guide my research
and understanding.

{% newthought 'Community' %} has always played a large role in my life and I want to mention
some of the great experiences I've had engaging with my community. In my time at
Davis I had the great fortune to serve as a board member and fundraiser
for the Yolo Interfaith Immigration Network{% sidenote "YIIN" 
"[YIIN website](https://www.yiinyolo.org/), and their
[donations page](https://yolo-interfaith-immigration-network.square.site/)" %}.
YIIN is a wonderful organization which has been serving and
advocating for immigrants for over a decade, and I recommend donating to them
whenever the inclination strikes you. If you're local, they are also a great
organization to volunteer with.

As an undergrad I spent a few summers as a counselor at SATELLITE Camp{% sidenote "SAT" 
"[SATELLITE's Mission page](https://caldwellfellows.ncsu.edu/mission/), and
[how to sponsor a camper](https://caldwellfellows.ncsu.edu/how-to-sponsor-campers/)" %}, a STEM
outreach and leadership development program for students from rural North
Carolina high schools. Each year about 60 students spend five nights at NCSU to
learn about science and technology related educational and career paths. Each
year working with them was transformative.
